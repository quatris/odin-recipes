    <h2>Easy and fast, these Cheddar cheese fries are served with bacon and dipped in ranch dressing.</h2>
    <p>A simple, tasty-delicious recipe. Came across it at lunchtime and had to make it right away! I agree with other raters that more cheese and bacon would be needed for a whole bag of fries. I used potato wedges and white cheddar cheese, and chopped green onion. My husband is a vegetarian so I used real bacon for mine and vegetarian "facon bits" on his. Both worked well and I'll make it again, adding garlic next time.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 slices bacon</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) package frozen French fries</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>Ranch dressing</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; crumble.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Place a piece of aluminum foil over a baking sheet; spread fries in a single layer on baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until golden brown and crisp, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat broiler.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle fries with cheese and crumbled bacon.</li>
        <li>Broil until cheese is melted, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve with Ranch dressing.</li>
    </ol>
