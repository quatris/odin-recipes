    <h2>Seven different kinds of cheese loving goodness.</h2>
    <p>I personally love this Mac n cheese, it does make quite a bit tho so if cooking for a single family I would recommend you half your entire recipe. Also if you like creamier Mac n cheese try using 1-2 less eggs. Other then that I make this every year for thanksgiving and there is always never any leftover. Enjoy! Happy Holidays! </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>12 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup cubed Velveeta cheese</li>
        <li>6 cups half-and-half, divided</li>
        <li>4 cups grated sharp yellow Cheddar, divided</li>
        <li>2 cups grated extra-sharp white Cheddar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups grated mozzarella</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Asiago</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Gruyere</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Monterey Jack</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Muenster</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil. Add the macaroni and cook until slightly al dente, about 10 minutes. Drain and set aside to keep warm.</li>
        <li>Whisk the eggs in a large bowl until frothy.</li>
        <li>Add the Velveeta, butter and 2 cups of the half-and-half to the large bowl of eggs. Add the warm macaroni tossing until the cheese has melted and the mixture is smooth. Add the remaining half-and-half, 3 cups of the sharp yellow Cheddar, the remaining grated cheeses, and salt and pepper, tossing until completely combined in the large bowl.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture into 9 by 13-inch casserole or baking dishes (approximately 3 (3-quart) baking dishes) and bake for 30 minutes. Sprinkle with the remaining 1 cup of sharp yellow cheese and bake until golden brown on top, about 30 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Serve hot.</li>
